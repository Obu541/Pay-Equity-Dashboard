- **Salary Distribution by Gender** (Box Plot) – shows pay spread and outliers between male and female employees
- **Average Salary by Job Level and Gender** – side-by-side bars comparing male vs. female salaries at each level
- **Gender Representation by Job Level** – count of male and female employees across different job levels
